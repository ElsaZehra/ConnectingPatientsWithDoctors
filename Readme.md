Connecting patients with doctors
Language: JAVA
Used: Android
Project Description: It was an android application. The basic idea behind this app was to heal at home. Avoid waiting at doctor’s offices, booking appointments or last-minute cancellations. Instead of ignoring/avoiding symptoms, you can now privately discuss health issues with our expert doctors, get valuable opinions and get hospital-quality nursing care at your place of convenience.
